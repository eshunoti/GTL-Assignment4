    <p>The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been declared a Public Health Emergency of
        International Concern (PHEIC) and the virus has now spread to many countries and territories. While a lot
        is still unknown about the virus that causes COVID-19, we do know that it is transmitted through direct
        contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing)
        Individuals can also be infected from touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and touching their
        face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). While COVID-19 continues to spread it is important that communities take
        action to prevent further transmission, reduce the impacts of the outbreak and support control measures.
        The protection of children and educational facilities is particularly important. Precautions are necessary to
        prevent the potential spread of COVID-19 in school settings; however, care must also be taken to avoid
        stigmatizing students and staff who may have been exposed to the virus. It is important to remember that
        COVID-19 does not differentiate between borders, ethnicities, disability status, age or gender. Education
        settings should continue to be welcoming, respectful, inclusive, and supportive environments to all.
        Measures taken by schools can prevent the entry and spread of COVID-19 by students and staff who may
        have been exposed to the virus, while minimizing disruption and protecting students and staff from
        discrimination</p>
